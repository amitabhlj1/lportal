                        <h5>Abstract:</h5>

                        <p>An Introduction to the origin of foreign language instruction in India:</p>
                        <p>1990's witnessed the rise of foreign language instruction in India. Foreign language instruction, since then has become an integral part of the college/university curriculum in India. Relationship with the classical languages originally defined the place of foreign language in the academic curriculum.</h5>
                        <p>At first, there was a notion among the natives that the modern languages (foreign languages) were not worthy a discipline to revert to books. To tackle this issue of reputation, the modern language departments modeled themselves after two respected disciplines namely:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The philological study of languages (the history of language combined with the reading texts illustrating earlier phases of the language)</li>
                                <li>Classical studies (the analysis of literary texts that form part of the cannon)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        
                        <h5>Importance and Depth of Learning a Foreign language</h5>

                        <ol>

                            <li>Personal<br/>A person who is openly receptive to new culture which comes with learning a new language is blessed with the ability to reinforce their own identity and thereby the self-confidence. Study of a new language, communication with the natives of the language and knowing about their culture is both a source of pleasure and personal enrichment. Knowledge of a foreign language will enables to compare and contrast cultural concepts.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                        <p>Learning a new language is like setting out for a new discovery which is more like an adventure. You will hardly be aware of what lies in store for you at the finishing point. But yes, there is much more to learning a language than learning its phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, and definitely, its literature. Learning a language also means learning its socio-cultural background and also studying and accepting the culture of the other. It also means knowing or learning ones own culture from a new perspective.</p>
