                        <p>A voiceless and speechless World is like a lifeless, barren desert. But the God's most invaluable gift of speech and language to the mankind has made this World beautiful like a heaven.</p>
                        <p>This gift not only helped man in developing good relations but also in earning livelihood. There has been a significant rise in the importance of languages with the transformation of the career outlook of students. There has been a sudden thrust in the field of linguistics.</p>
                        <p>Language skills can prove to be an essential attribute in many professions. A career in foreign language has always been an attractive proposition, especially for those who are determined, confident and most important have flair for languages.</p>
                        <p>The specialist language occupations include working as a translator, interpreter, language teacher or linguist.

                        <p>To be translator you need the ability to write and express yourself very well in the target language, usually your native tongue and a good knowledge of the source languages, usually foreign languages. Apart from having linguistic skills, a translator must possess adequate knowledge in the area of work so as to maintain the style and essence of the original text.</p>
                        <p>Many translators are self-employed and find clients themselves or work for translation agencies, which find clients and arrange payment. There are also positions for in-house translators in some large organizations. Translators are usually paid per word in the source language. A translator gets Rs. 400/- to Rs. 600/- for translating a page from a foreign language to English and visa-versa.</p>
                        <p>Interpreter's job relates to interpreting spoken words of one language into another. Therefore, an interpreter needs to have not only good command over the language but having excellent verbal communication skills also become important.</p>

Sometimes they are engaged in Simultaneous Interpretation, which is used for meetings, conferences, speeches, etc. Here the interpreters sits in a sound proof room and listens to speeches and almost spontaneously interprets it in the target language into a microphone.</p>

Liaison Interpreting is to facilitate conversation between two people knowing different languages.</p>

                        <p>Each new form of human speech introduces one into a new world of thought and life. So in some degree, learning is like traversing other continents and mingling with other races.</p>
                        <p>So for those who have been longing for a career in languages, move ahead, just give up all misconceptions and get into the fray.</p>
