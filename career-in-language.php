                        <p>The specialist language occupations include working as a translator, interpreter, language teacher or linguist. But now with the globalization of Indian economy, multi-nationals coming to India and more and more companies going for joint ventures abroad have opened up job scenario for those proficient in foreign languages. Academic qualifications in foreign languages help in pursuing careers in the areas of tourism, entertainment, public relations and mass communication, international organizations, embassies, diplomatic service, publishing, etc.</p>

                        <p>To be translator you need the ability to write and express yourself very well in the target language, usually your native tongue and a good knowledge of the source languages, usually foreign languages. Apart from having linguistic skills, a translator must possess adequate knowledge in the area of work so as to maintain the style and essence of the original text.</p>
                        <p>Many translators are self-employed and find clients themselves or work for translation agencies, which find clients and arrange payment.
